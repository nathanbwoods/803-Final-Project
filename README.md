# 803 Final Project

YOLOv5 is a publicly available image classifier with a Python interface.  Starcraft II is a computer strategy game, in which sci-fi units engage in battle.  In 2019, a ML agent called AlphaStar beat top world Starcraft II players; however, it did not play the game using the standard interface, but required a tailored API.  We worked to bridge the gap between AlphaStar and normal play by training an image classifier model to identify unit classes through the standard perspective camera.
